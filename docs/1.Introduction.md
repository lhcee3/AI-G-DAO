# 1. Introduction

The AI-G-DAO (AI-Governed Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a revolutionary climate action platform that combines artificial intelligence with the carbon-negative Algorand blockchain to democratize environmental governance. Through AI-powered proposal analysis and transparent voting mechanisms, we enable communities to collectively address climate challenges while earning Climate Impact Credits (CICs) for verified environmental contributions.

## Vision & Mission

**Vision**: To create the world's first AI-governed climate DAO that empowers global communities to take decisive climate action through transparent, efficient, and scientifically-backed decision-making.

**Mission**: Accelerate climate solutions by leveraging artificial intelligence to analyze, validate, and fund environmental projects while maintaining complete transparency and democratic governance through blockchain technology.
