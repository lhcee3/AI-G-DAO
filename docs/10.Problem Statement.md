# Problem Statement: Climate Funding Crisis

## The Critical Challenge

### Climate Financing Gap
- **$2.4 trillion** annually needed for climate action by 2030
- **Current funding**: Only $83.3 billion in climate finance flows
- **Gap**: Over 95% of required funding is missing
- **Traditional barriers**: Complex bureaucracy, lack of transparency, high transaction costs

### Traditional Climate Funding Problems

#### 1. **Centralized Decision Making**
- Limited stakeholder participation
- Opaque allocation processes
- Political and geographic biases
- Slow approval cycles (6-18 months average)

#### 2. **High Transaction Costs**
- Administrative overhead: 15-30% of total funding
- Multiple intermediary fees
- Currency conversion losses
- Legal and compliance costs

#### 3. **Lack of Impact Verification**
- No real-time monitoring
- Limited accountability measures
- Difficult to track fund utilization
- Post-hoc reporting only

#### 4. **Accessibility Barriers**
- Small-scale projects excluded
- Complex application processes
- Geographic limitations
- Language and technical barriers
